## Key Learnings: Git Branching & Collaboration Simulation

While implementing the Dark Mode feature, I focused on simulating a professional team workflow using Git. This involved learning and applying core **version control** concepts directly from my local VS Code environment to the remote repository.

### Core Achievements:

- **Branching Workflow:** I practiced creating new feature branches (*git checkout -b feature/dark-mode*), committing changes locally, and pushing those branches to the remote repository.

- **Version Management:** I learned why it is crucial to avoid direct pushes to the *main* branch, simulating how a team uses branches to isolate new, unstable code and prevent disruptions to the live version.

- **Merge Request Simulation:** I understood the step-by-step process of preparing a branch for merging, which requires a clean commit history and passing checks (simulating CI/CD and code review) before the final commit is merged into *main*.

This exercise provided a strong foundation in **collaborative development principles** and the operational necessity of using a branching strategy for reliable project delivery.
